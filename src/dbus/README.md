# Low Level Bluez Dbus interfaces

Those are the low level Dbus interfaces. They can be used separately without using the convenience wrapper of the main library.
Or in conjunction with the library to make up for some missing functionality.

## Usage

### Connect
The get an instance of an interface you can use the Interface::Connect method to directly 

Example:
```ts
const bus = Dbus.systemBus();
const leMgr = await OrgBluezLEAdvertisingManager1.Connect(bus, "/org/bluez/hci0");
```

### ProxyObject
If you already have a Proxy object from the bus. You can simply call the constructor

Example:
```ts
const bus = Dbus.systemBus();
const obj = await bus.getProxyObject("/org/bluez/hci0");
const leMgr = new OrgBluezLEAdvertisingManager1(obj);
```

### Library
If you have a library Bluez object you can also use its `getDbusObjectInterface` method for convenience.

Example:
```ts
const bluez = new Bluez();
const leMgr = await bluez.getDbusObjectInterface(OrgBluezLEAdvertisingManager1, "/org/bluez/hci0");
```


## Generation
Those interfaces are generated by dbus-next client interface generator.

1. Connect devices with different interfaces to populate all Dbus Nodes.
2. Then run the generator:
```bash
./helper/dbus-client-interface-generator.js --system --full -p --variant-any -t typescript-class-auto.ts -o src/dbus/ -r org.bluez /
```
3. If necessary remove XML for device specific interfaces.
